To manually add a dataset you must adhere to the following naming convention:
- Dataset folder name:	"User(any_number)"					e.g. "User(0)"
- Class folder name:  	"Class_Name"						e.g. "Right"
- Example file name:  	"Class_Name(i)" where i = 0,1,...,number of examples-1	e.g. "Right(0)"

Please also refer to the "Datasets" folder to see how the existing datasets are named.
