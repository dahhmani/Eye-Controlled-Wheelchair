## Overview
This is a real-time eye tracking framework that renders any electric wheelchair driven by eye movements.
It implements a Convolutional Neural Network that performs gaze estimation on an UDOO X86 embedded platform with an accuracy of 99.3% and at a frame rate of 99 FPS.

</p>

The framework consists of four applications:
1. ```EyeTracker_Calibrate``` acquire and label user-specific eye images automatically, then learn a gaze classifier from them
2. ```EyeTracker_Test``` test the learned model's performance in gaze estimation, and output all the necessary results
3. ```EyeTracker_Deploy``` deploy the tested model to infer the user's gaze direction in real-time, and communicate it to a microcontroller which takes the appropriate action
4. ```CNN_HyperparametersSearch``` implement cross-validation which is used to select the model architecture
